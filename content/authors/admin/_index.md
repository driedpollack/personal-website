Taehyun Hwang is a postdoctoral researcher at the [Graduate School of Data Science](https://gsds.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University, under the supervision of Prof. [Min-hwan Oh](https://minoh.io).
He received his Ph.D. in Data Science from Seoul National University under the supervision of Prof. Min-hwan Oh, his M.S. in Mathematics from Sungkyunkwan University under the supervision of Prof. [Yongdo Lim](https://dblp.org/pid/25/3420.html) and Prof. [Rhee Man Kil](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dTiJInMAAAAJ&hl=en), and his B.S. in Mathematics from Kyungpook National University.

His research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and decision-making under uncertainty, including reinforcement learning, contextual bandits, and statistical machine learning. He is particularly interested in extending mathematical principles and uncovering the fundamental limits of machine learning algorithms.
